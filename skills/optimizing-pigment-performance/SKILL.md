## Performance Optimization Workflow

### Step 1: Use the Profiler First

- [ ] Open profiler and analyze actual bottleneck
- [ ] Identify scope chips (⚫ black / 🔵 blue / 🔘 gray)
- [ ] Note scope notation (2/2, 0/3, etc.)
- [ ] Trace computation chains
- [ ] Document findings before optimizing

### Step 2: Search & Read Documentation

- [ ] Identify issue type from profiler (scope loss, densification, iteration, etc.)
- [ ] Search this SKILL.md for relevant section
- [ ] Read documentation files listed

### Step 3: Optimize and Re-Profile

- [ ] Apply optimization patterns
- [ ] Re-profile to verify improvement
- [ ] Document before/after measurements

## Core Performance Principles

1. **Scope First** - Start formulas with scoping clauses
2. **Preserve Sparsity** - Use ISDEFINED instead of ISBLANK
3. **Reduce Early** - Aggregate or filter data early
4. **Profile Systematically** - Use profiler, not assumptions
5. **Understand Scope Propagation** - Know when and why scope is lost

## Essential Files

**[./performance_profiler_usage.md](./performance_profiler_usage.md)** - Complete profiler guide

**Covers**: Scope chips, computation chains, profiler interpretation, scope notation

**Always start with profiler** - Don't optimize based on assumptions

**[./performance_scoping_patterns.md](./performance_scoping_patterns.md)** - Scope mechanics

**Covers**: Scope propagation, early scoping strategies, preservation techniques

## Task-Based Routing

### Understanding Profiler Output

**Questions**:

- "What does the blue chip mean?"
- "Why is my scope showing 0/3?"
- "How do I trace slow computation?"

**Read**: [./performance_profiler_usage.md](./performance_profiler_usage.md)

**Quick Reference**:

- **⚫ Black Chip**: Scope preserved and passed downstream
- **🔵 Blue Chip**: New scope introduced (dimension added)
- **🔘 Gray Chip**: Computation triggered but no output change

### Optimizing Slow Formulas

**Questions**:

- "My formula takes 10 seconds, how to speed it up?"
- "Should I use IF or FILTER?"
- "How do I scope early?"

**Read in order**:

1. [./performance_formula_optimization.md](./performance_formula_optimization.md)
2. [./performance_scoping_patterns.md](./performance_scoping_patterns.md)
3. [./performance_sparsity_deep_dive.md](./performance_sparsity_deep_dive.md)

### Managing Sparsity

**Questions**:

- "Should I use ISBLANK or ISDEFINED?"
- "Why is my metric suddenly much larger?"
- "How do I avoid densifying metrics?"

**Read**: [./performance_sparsity_deep_dive.md](./performance_sparsity_deep_dive.md)

**Key principles**: Use **ISDEFINED** instead of **ISBLANK** to preserve sparsity. Use **dimension-typed metrics in BY** to drive sparsity. **Avoid ISBLANK/ISNOTBLANK for sparsity** — they densify over large spaces.

### Understanding Scope Loss

**Questions**:

- "Why did I lose scope after using REMOVE?"
- "How does CUMULATE affect scope?"
- "When is scope loss unavoidable?"

**Read**: [./performance_scoping_patterns.md](./performance_scoping_patterns.md)

### Optimizing Iterative Calculations

**Questions**:

- "My PREVIOUS calculation over 3 years of daily data is timing out"
- "How do I optimize CUMULATE?"
- "Should I use FILLFORWARD or PREVIOUS?"

**Read**: [./performance_iterative_calculations.md](./performance_iterative_calculations.md)

### Optimizing Access Rights Performance

**Questions**:

- "Why are my AR metrics so slow?"
- "What's the ISDEFINED(User) pattern?"

**Read**: [./performance_access_rights.md](./performance_access_rights.md)

### Conducting a Performance Audit

**Questions**:

- "Where do I start?"
- "How do I identify biggest bottlenecks?"
- "What's the systematic approach?"

**Read**: [./performance_troubleshooting_workflow.md](./performance_troubleshooting_workflow.md)

### Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                    | Why Bad                 | Fix                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ISBLANK instead of ISDEFINED    | Densifies metrics       | Use ISDEFINED              |
| IF(ISBLANK(A), B, A)            | More complex            | Use IFBLANK(A, B)          |
| ISBLANK/ISNOTBLANK for sparsity | Densify over large space | Use BY + dimension-typed metrics or ISDEFINED/IFDEFINED/IFBLANK/EXCLUDE |
| Guarding BY with IF(ISBLANK(metric), BLANK, …) | Redundant, densifies | Use BY alone; dimension-typed metric in BY drives sparsity |
| Not scoping early               | Unnecessary computation | Add FILTER/EXCLUDE first   |
| Unnecessary REMOVE              | Loses scope             | Remove only when needed    |
| Long dense horizons in PREVIOUS | Exponential time        | Subset time dimensions     |
| No ISDEFINED(User) in AR        | Computes for all users  | Wrap AR in ISDEFINED(User) |

### Scope Chips

| Chip     | Meaning                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| ⚫ Black | Scope preserved                  |
| 🔵 Blue  | New scope introduced             |
| 🔘 Gray  | Computation but no output change |

### Scope Notation

| Notation | Meaning                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 2/2      | Full scope (all dimensions scoped)     |
| 2/3      | Partial scope (some dimensions scoped) |
| 0/3      | No scope (full recomputation required) |

### Performance Checklist

- [ ] Start formulas with scoping (FILTER, EXCLUDE, ISDEFINED)
- [ ] Use ISDEFINED instead of ISBLANK
- [ ] Use IFBLANK instead of IF(ISBLANK())
- [ ] Use BY with dimension-typed metrics for sparsity; avoid ISBLANK/ISNOTBLANK for sparsity
- [ ] Aggregate early with BY modifier
- [ ] Avoid unnecessary REMOVE
- [ ] Subset time dimensions for iterative calculations
- [ ] Add ISDEFINED(User) to AR-heavy formulas
- [ ] Profile before and after optimization
