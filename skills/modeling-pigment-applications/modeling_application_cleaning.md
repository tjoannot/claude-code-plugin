# Pigment Application Cleaning -- Agent Rules and Workflows

**Purpose:** Define a strict, deletion-focused approach to cleaning a Pigment **application** for execution by an agent. **Cleaning = deletion** only; "unused" is determined from **Pigment system truth** (settings, dependency graphs, usage analytics), not human judgment. Formula refactoring, optimization, renaming, and folder organization are out of scope for this cleaning phase.

---

## Core Principles

- **Cleaning = Deletion.** Only actions that remove objects from the application belong to the core cleaning phase. Renaming, folders, naming alignment are optional hygiene (Phase 2), not covered here.
- **System truth over human opinion.** "Unused" is determined exclusively from Pigment settings, dependency graphs, and usage analytics. No interviews, no inferred intent.
- **No formula changes.** Formulas are optimization; explicitly excluded from cleaning.
- **Two independent cleaning axes:**
  1. **Structural objects** (dimensions, metrics, tables, properties)
  2. **Boards** (usage-based only)

## Cleaning Phases (Scope of This Doc)

| Phase       | Scope                               | Mandatory               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | Deletion of unused objects          | Yes — this document     |
| **Phase 2** | Renaming, folders, naming alignment | Optional (not cleaning) |

This document covers **Phase 1** only.

---

## Phase 1 -- Structural Cleaning (Settings-Based)

### Source of Truth

For all structural objects use **Pigment Settings** only:

- Dependency graphs
- Explicit references
- UI exposure metadata

No interviews, no inferred intent.

### Object Processing Order (Mandatory)

1. **Dimensions**
2. **Metrics**
3. **Tables** (Tables / Transaction Lists)
4. **Properties** (list fields)

Changing this order increases the risk of false positives. Cleaning is **iterative**: after deleting boards or metrics, recompute usage and then delete newly unused tables, then dimensions.

---

## Definition of "Unused" (Machine-Readable)

### Dimensions

A dimension is **unused** only if **all** are true:

- Not referenced by any table
- Not referenced by any metric
- Not referenced by any property
- Not used in any board or page (axis, filter, segmentation)

| Usage count | Action                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 0           | Candidate for deletion |
| > 0         | Do not touch           |

There is no "rarely used" concept.

---

### Metrics

A metric is **unused** if:

- Not referenced by any other metric
- Not displayed in any board or page
- Not used in any configured export

**Note:** Being inside a table is **not** considered usage for this definition.

| Downstream references | UI exposure | Action                 |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 0                     | 0           | Candidate for deletion |
| >= 1                  | any         | Keep                   |

No merging, renaming, or formula edits in this phase.

---

### Tables (Transaction Lists / Tables)

A table is **unused** if:

- No downstream consumers (metrics, boards, other tables)
- No active input updates (for input tables)
- No connected exports or integrations

**Special case:** Tables used only as historical or staging layers are candidates **only if** no boards consume them.

---

### Properties (List Fields)

A property is **unused** if:

- Not referenced in any formula
- Not used as filter or display field
- Not visible in the UI

Optional strong signal: never populated with data.

**Process:** Hide -> Observe -> Delete. No type changes, no renaming in this phase.

---

## Deletion Workflow (All Structural Objects)

1. Identify unused object via settings (dependency + exposure).
2. Disable / hide object.
3. **Observation period** (e.g. minimum one business cycle; duration to be agreed with solution architect — e.g. 30 / 60 / 90 days).
4. Final deletion after observation.
5. Log deletion event (who / what / when / why).

Silence during the observation window is treated as approval. For contested or seasonal use, clarify with solution architect: observation window, whitelisting of seasonal/annual boards, minimum deletion batch size per run.

---

## Phase 1 -- Boards Cleaning (Usage-Based)

Boards are **not** evaluated by structural references. Only **usage analytics** apply.

### Source of Truth for Boards

- `last_viewed_at`
- `view_count` (rolling window)
- `unique_viewers`
- Viewer role (admin vs business user)

A board viewed **only by admins** is **not** considered used for cleaning.

### Definition of "Unused Board"

Within a defined time window (e.g. 90 days):

- **Unused** if: `view_count = 0` **OR** `unique_non_admin_viewers = 0`
- Seasonality or annual-only usage must be explicitly whitelisted (clarify with solution architect).

### Board Classification

| Category   | Criteria                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| **ACTIVE** | Viewed by >= 1 business user   |
| **STALE**  | Viewed only by admins/builders |
| **DEAD**   | No views in the time window    |

### Board Deletion Workflow

**DEAD boards:**

1. Auto-tag `TO_BE_DELETED`
2. Notify owner (if any)
3. Contestation window
4. Delete

**STALE boards:** No automatic deletion. Strong signal for future cleaning; often allows downstream structural cleaning (deleting metrics/tables/dimensions that only served those boards).

Boards are frequently the **primary trigger** that enables deeper structural cleaning. Recommended sequence: delete dead boards -> recompute structural usage -> delete newly unused metrics -> recompute -> tables -> dimensions.

---

## Agent Execution Logic (Conceptual)

When executing a cleaning task:

1. **Start with boards** — classify all boards (ACTIVE / STALE / DEAD) using usage analytics.
2. **Delete DEAD boards** — follow board deletion workflow.
3. **Recompute structural usage** — after board deletion, re-evaluate all structural objects.
4. **Process structural objects in order** — dimensions -> metrics -> tables -> properties.
5. **For each object type** — identify unused, hide, observe, delete.
6. **Log all actions** — maintain an audit trail.
7. **Iterate** — deletion of one layer may unlock deletion in the next.
